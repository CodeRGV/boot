# Guestbook on Heroku
#### Week 6 {Foundation Challenge}

### Assignment
Now that Guestbook is done, it's time for the world to see your projects. Today you will publish your guestbook, into heroku! You will need to set up MongoDB using mLab. 

#### Notes

- You will need to update the MongoDB URIs in your code.
- Use your Github repo, and link it with Heroku.
- **Do not** commit your usernames and passwords to github

### Submission
This will be simple, post your heroku link to slack and you will be done! If you are done, and have extra time make sure your Guestbook is *beautiful,* the nicer the better! After that review a bit for [Angular](https://thinkster.io/a-better-way-to-learn-angularjs). We'll be using this resource quite a bit.
