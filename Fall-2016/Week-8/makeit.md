# Make it - *if it ain't broke break it*
#### Week 8 - {Capstone Project}

### Assignment
For Week-8 you will be remaking your favorite website. You will create everything from the front-end to the back-end, this is a big project so we will break it down a bit.

#### Part 1 - Proposal
**Before you start coding**, you will submit a proposal on what you want to make. Your proposal can be handwritten and we'll be discussed in a 1-1 conversation.

Your proposal, at a minimum, should include:
* What website you are remaking and why?
* A model of your database, how are you going to store everything? Are there any relations? Are there any bottlenecks, speed considerations?
* A model of your API, what routes will you use? How will you authenticate your users? Angular, React, EJS?
* Where will it be hosted? Heroku, AWS, Linode, Digital Ocean?
* What are you goals for the week? What will you do to make sure you meet those goals?

*Note: During the proposal conference more questions will be asked, make sure you know exactly what you are making and how you will make it*

You will only be allowed to start coding after you receive approval on your proposal. Proposal meetings will happen virtually Friday and over the weekend and in-person on Monday. Reach out to @Jose on Slack to schedule.

#### Part 2 - Coding
You can use any tool, any framework, anything. There are some restrictions:
* You must track your project on Github, you must have frequent commits. At least 2 a day.
* Your code must be commented, use [jsdoc standards](http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html).
* Your Github repo must have a `README.md` describing your project, how it works and how I can deploy it and use it.
* Your project must be publicly accessible, and a URL to it must be available in your `README.md`
* **DO NOT** get distracted with other projects, unless you are completely finished to an excellent standard. Also do not be absent unless you have an excuse. These last couple of weeks are critical.

*Not a requirement but **highly** encouraged:*
* Make sure your app is fully covered with automated tests. Look more into [Unit testing](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-hero-node-js-unit-testing-tutorial/)
